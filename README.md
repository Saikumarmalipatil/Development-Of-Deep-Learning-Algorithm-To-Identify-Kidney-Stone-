# Development of Deep-Learning Algorithm to Identify Kidney Stones

Kidney Stone Detection using Deep Learning
This project is a deep learning-based application designed to detect kidney stones in medical images. It leverages a trained InceptionV3 model within a simple graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter, allowing users to select, view, and classify images.

Overview
The Kidney Stone Detection application aims to assist in identifying kidney stones in medical images. The tool provides an intuitive interface for uploading an image, previewing it within the application, and classifying it using a deep learning model. The application outputs whether a kidney stone is detected in the image.

Features
Image Upload and Preview: Allows users to select and preview the image within the GUI.
Kidney Stone Detection: Classifies images using a pre-trained deep learning model.
Clear Results: Provides a button to clear the current image and reset the application for new classifications.

Installation
Install the required dependencies from requirements.txt.

Download the trained model (model_inceptionv3t1.h5) and place it in the designated models/ directory (or update the path in the code to match the location).

Ensure you have the correct versions of Python and dependencies installed for compatibility with TensorFlow and Keras.

Usage
Launch the application by running app.py.

In the GUI:
Browse Image: Select an image file to classify.
Classify Image: The model will predict whether a kidney stone is present in the image.
Clear Image: Reset the application to allow for another image upload and classification.
Results are displayed in the GUI, with messages indicating the presence or absence of a kidney stone.

Model Details
This application uses a fine-tuned InceptionV3 model for binary classification of medical images. It classifies images into two categories:
Kidney Stone Detected: If a kidney stone is identified in the image.
No Kidney Stone Detected: If no kidney stones are found in the image.
